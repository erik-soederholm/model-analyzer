xUML Model Analyzer by translating Model data into a Datalog representation

# Purpose
The purpose of the xUML Model Analyzer is to provide a static analysis of xUML models. This in hope of being able use this analysis in the model to code translation. First (and boring) step is to translate the models into Datalog. After that the real work begins...

# Disclaimer
At its current status this is not more then a messy prototype and it might never become any more then that. The main reason for adding this to github now is that it gives some context to work related to its dependencies. Currently flatland-model-diagram-editor and soon shlaer-mellor-metamodel is affected by this work.
